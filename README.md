# Cafe Chozen

Welcome to Cafe Chozen! 

You've come in the nick of time! All of our servers have called out sick! I'm so glad you are willing to help me serve today at the last minute! 


## Game Play

We have eight tasty items on the menu.  Each customer will place an order. Drag and drop the item over the customer's order to serve them. If you serve the correct dish, their table will turn green and you will score a point. Serve three customers the correct entrees in each round to win.

Don't forget to cook the items! Items must be cooked and ready to SERVE before they can be given to a customer. If items sit too long they will have to be thrown away. If the customer has to wait too long for service they will leave. 

I'm counting on you!
